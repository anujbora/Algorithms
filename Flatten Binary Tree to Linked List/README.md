Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

Example :
```
         1
        / \
       2   5
      / \   \
     3   4   6

The flatten tree should look like :

     1
      \
       2
        \
         3
          \
           4
            \
             5
              \
               6

```
